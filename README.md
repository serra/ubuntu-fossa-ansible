# ubuntu-fossa-ansible
Ansible script for setting up my Ubuntu Fossa machine(s?)

Goal: when setting up a new machine, I can just call this Ansible script and be up-and-running in no-time.

# Done

 * create an ansible install and config script (https://opensource.com/article/18/3/manage-your-workstation-configuration-ansible-part-2)
 * keyboard settings (now Dutch e.g. '+e gives Ã©, but this is annoying when coding
 * check wired headset and mic
 * 1 password (as firefox extension, is good enough)
 * copy dev pass database
 * copy keypairs
