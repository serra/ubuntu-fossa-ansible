# ubuntu-fossa-ansible
Ansible script for setting up my Ubuntu Fossa machine(s?)

Goal: when setting up a new machine, I can just call this Ansible script and be up-and-running in no-time.

# Done

 * Install 1-password in Firefox
 * Add Google mail and calendar accounts
 * Set up Ansible workflow for further setup of my machine
 * Pair Airpods Pro for headset, mic not working yet, [details](https://askubuntu.com/questions/922860/pairing-apple-airpods-as-headset).
 * create an ansible install and config script, from [blog post with ideas](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/manage-your-workstation-configuration-ansible-part-2)

# Backlog

Todo, preferably scripted, but do it either way.

 * pair airpods (use mic)
 * language settings (nl spell checker, en spel cheker, interface english)
 * keyboard settings (now Dutch e.g. '+e gives Ã©, but this is annoying when coding
 * check wired headset and mic
 * 1 password (as firefox extension, is good enough)
 * copy dev pass database
 * copy keypairs

apps:
